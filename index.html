    <p>The slated demolition of a historic mansion, the Charles Lindemann House, has reignited a push for historic preservation in Bushwick. A seven-story luxury apartment building is set to take its place.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Over the past 20 years, Bushwick has undergone a dramatic transformation. Historically a working-class, Latinx neighborhood, Bushwick has seen an influx of affluent newcomers attracted to the trendy arts scene. As new luxury developments are
      built and rent and housing prices continue to rise, many worry about displacement of long-term residents.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The demolition comes in the wake of a breakdown in rezoning negotiations between Bushwick and the city. Unveiled in 2018, the Bushwick Community Plan, formulated over several years by local elected officials and community members, sought to
      combat displacement through rezoning and the designation of three historic districts. These efforts stalled when the mayor rejected the plan in January of this year, leaving much of Bushwick ripe for development.</p>
    <br>
    <p>While customarily used to protect monuments like Grand Central Station and the Empire State Building, historic designation has increasingly been pursued by communities under siege of development, like Bushwick, to preserve their neighborhood’s
      cultural identity.</p>
    <br>
    <p>An analysis of data from the Landmarks Preservation Commission, the New York City agency tasked with designation and regulation of landmarks and historic districts under the 1965 Landmarks Law, revealed that while preservation efforts were
      concentrated in wealthy areas of Manhattan and Brooklyn at the outset, the percentage of historic districts designated in less-affluent areas has increased over the years. The map below illustrates this shift, as advocates in neighborhoods like
      Bedford-Stuyvesant, Crown Heights, and, most recently, East Flatbush, have successfully pushed for historic district designation as a way to manage development.</p><br>

    <p>“Advocacy has often focused on the more iconic neighborhoods in New York City, and that could be why sections of the outer boroughs have seen, traditionally, fewer districts designated,” said Erin Tobin, the vice president of policy at the
      Preservation League of New York State. “I think that's something that the LPC recognizes and is seeking to address.”</p>
    <br>
    <p>But not everyone agrees that historic district designation is the right means to prevent displacement. “We're talking about landmarking as a way of stopping development, which is the wrong tool,” said Louis Céspedes, an architect and city
      council candidate who vehemently opposed the designation of a historic district in East Flatbush. “Landmarking is not designed to do that. As much as we'd like it to, it's not going to work.” Once landmarked, properties require approval from
      the city for renovations and repairs, which can be an expensive and time-consuming burden for low-income communities. </p>
    <br>
    <p>The first historic district in East Flatbush was designated this past November. Whether Bushwick –– and other neighborhoods throughout the city –– will follow remains to be seen.</p>
